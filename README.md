# How to setup

Just start the launcher and follow instructions

# TODO

- [ ] Music cog (not likely)

- [x] Math command (without `eval()` and with `math` module support)

  - for now just without `eval()`

- [ ] Warn system (more likely than the music cog)

- [x] Launcher (wanna start simple but in future make update check)

  - For now simple and I want to make `check_config()` using RegEx
