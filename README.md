# How to setup

- Clone repo
- Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Insert token (`not-scripts/config.json`)
- Start `main.py`

# TODO

- [ ] Music cog (not likely)
- [ ] Math command (without eval() and with `math` module support)
- [x] Add fields to moderation commands
- [ ] Warn system (more likely than the music cog)
- [ ] Launcher (wanna start simple but in future make update check)
